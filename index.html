            "I was an ENT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been 
            Looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and 
            found it increadibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The nexxt 12 
            weeks was the best - and   most grueling - time of my life. Since completing course, I ve successfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer at VR starting."

             "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.iI needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programing step by step.I ws encouraged to enrool by a formar student of theirs who can only say wonderfull things about the program. The were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.In fact, I've often refered to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. it certainly helped me land a job as full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomended!
